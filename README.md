Please note: This repository has public access in order to show the process and status of my web API project and should by no means be mistaken for a fully polished software product.


- My current project developing a simple web API and deploying it automatically to a cloud container registry.

- For the CI pipeline I am using Docker, Pytest, Github Actions and AWS ECR.

- For the web API I am using FastAPI, Traefik, Postgres and SQLAlchemy.

- The app has implemented the standard CRUD routes GET, POST, PUT and DELETE for a notes table.
